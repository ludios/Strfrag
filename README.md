Strfrag overview
==================

[TODO]


Installation

`python setup.py install`

This installs the modules `strfrag` and `test_strfrag`.


Running the tests
=================

Install Twisted, then run `trial strfrag`


Code style notes
================

This package mostly follows the Divmod Coding Standard
<http://replay.web.archive.org/http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/CodingStandard> with a few exceptions:

*	Use hard tabs for indentation.

*	Use hard tabs only at the beginning of a line.

*	Prefer to have lines <= 80 characters, but always less than 100.
